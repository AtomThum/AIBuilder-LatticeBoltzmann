\chapter{Building the simulation framework}
\label{sec:model-building}

The implementation of the model in \texttt{Python} is different from the theoretical model due to some \texttt{NumPy} functions. This chapter serves as an overview for self-implementing the model. The codes in this chapter are not the actual code used in the \texttt{GitHub} repository. It's liberated from the object-oriented paradigms for ease of understanding. All of these will be pieced together in \cref{sec:model-structure}

This idea of implementing the simulation is actually an amalgamation of various ones. The article by \Citeauthor{adams-no-date} \cite{adams-no-date} and \Citeauthor{schroeder-2012} \cite{schroeder-2012} gave us a very comprehensive overview of the Lattice-Boltzmann method with boundaries condition, and also provided us with the intuition for creating our own ways of implementing. The inspiration for using the roll function is from \Citeauthor{matias-2022}'s video on Lattice-Boltzmann simulator \cite{matias-2022}. However, that video is quite old and uses a rather strange technique of implementing the boundary conditions, which leads to many numerical instabilities. Most of the time that's spent on this project is to make the boundary condition work. At the end, it did work, with the by product of sweat and tears. We don't want anyone to suffer through them with us. So, here is how we did it.

\section{Preliminary quantities}

The packages that are used throughout the project are imported as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import itertools as itr
from scipy.ndimage import convolve
import copy
import random
import math
\end{minted}
And, here are the invariant arrays that are used throughout the project:
\begin{minted}{python}
unitVect = np.array(
    [
        [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1],
        [-1, 0], [0, -1], [1, 1],
        [-1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, -1]
    ]
)
unitX = np.array([0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, -1, -1, 1])
unitY = np.array([0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1])
weight = np.array([4/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/36, 1/36, 1/36, 1/36])
\end{minted}
The \texttt{unitVect} array represents the set of vectors $\vv{e}_i$ where $i = 1, 2, 3,\dots, 8$. \texttt{unitY} and \texttt{unitX} represents $\vv{e}_i\vdot\yhat$ and $\vv{e}_i\vdot\xhat$ respectively. Lastly, the \texttt{weight} array represents the weight that's used to calculate the fluid equilibrium ($\vv{E}_i$) in \cref{eq:self-collision-calculation-1,eq:lbm-weights,eq:self-collision-calculation-2}.

\section{Preliminary functions}

\subsection{Representation of physical quantities}

The whole lattice is represented as a \texttt{NumPy} array with dimensions $(N, M, 9)$. The first axis represents the $y$ index, second represents the $x$ index, and the third one with nine elements represent the fluid vectors $\vv{f}_0, \dots, \vv{f}_8$. Since these fluid vectors actually represents the amount of fluid that's travelling inside a cell, the vectors cannot be zero. Thus, the array is set to be all ones even when the fluid at rest. One can simply initialize the array as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
yResolution = 24 # Configurable
xResolution = 36 # Configurable
fluid = np.ones(yResolution, xResolution, 9)
# The fluid array is to be modified according to the desired initial condition
initCondition = copy.deepcopy(fluid)
\end{minted}
The array \texttt{initCondition} serves as a reference for plotting in the future.

For simplicity, we also define two arrays that are used throughout: \texttt{yIndex} and \texttt{xIndex}. They are arrays that are filled with numbers from $0$ to $y - 1$, and $0$ to $x - 1$ respectively.
\begin{minted}{python}
yIndex = np.arange(yResolution)
xIndex = np.arange(xResolution)
\end{minted}

In the simulation step that is documented later in \cref{sec:simulation-function}, there must be a function that updates the density, momentum density, and velocity density of the fluid every time the simulation runs. First, we initialize the arrays that contain the density, momentum density, and the velocity density of the fluid according to \cref{eq:density-calculation,eq:momentum-calculation,eq:velocity-calculation}:
\begin{minted}{python}
density = np.sum(fluid, axis=2)
momentumY = np.sum(fluid * unitY, axis=2)
momentumX = np.sum(fluid * unitX, axis=2)
speedY = momentumY / density
speedX = momentumX / density
speedY = np.nan_to_num(speedY, posinf=0, neginf=0, nan=0)
speedX = np.nan_to_num(speedX, posinf=0, neginf=0, nan=0)
\end{minted}
The function \texttt{np.nan\_to\_num} is used to deal with infinities that might occur in the velocity calculation step. At the wall boundary condition where there's no fluid there; hence, zero density. Since the velocity is the ratio between momentum and fluid density, the velocity at the wall diverges to infinity, which it really shouldn't. So, we convert those infinities to zero by using the \texttt{np.nan\_to\_num}.

These arrays are then updated using the following functions:
\begin{minted}{python}
def updateDensity():
    density = np.sum(fluid, axis=2)

def updateMomentum():
    momentumY = np.sum(fluid * unitY, axis=2)
    momentumX = np.sum(fluid * unitX, axis=2)

def updateSpeed():
    updateDensity()
    updateMomentum()

    speedY = momentumY / density
    speedX = momentumX / density
    speedY = np.nan_to_num(speedY, posinf=0, neginf=0, nan=0)
    speedX = np.nan_to_num(speedX, posinf=0, neginf=0, nan=0)
\end{minted}
They are literally the calculation codes, but converted into a callable function.   Since \texttt{updateSpeed} calls both \texttt{updateDensity} and \texttt{updateMomentum}, one doesn't have to call \texttt{updateDensity} and \texttt{updateMomentum} when the function \texttt{updateSpeed} is already called.

\subsection{Wall boundary conditions}

The wall boundaries condition is stored as another array with dimensions $(N, M)$ filled with boolean elements. If a position $(n, m)$ is \texttt{True}, then it is not a wall, else, it's a wall. This array can be used to easily impose the wall boundary condition on the \texttt{fluid} array. I.e., every point where there's a wall, there must be zero fluid; thus, the fluid vectors at those points shall be zero.
\begin{minted}{python}
boundary = np.full((yResolution, xResolution))
# Can be edited to be any shape desired.
fluid[boundary, :] = 0
\end{minted}

There are four types of wall that's implemented in this framework: circular, border, and rectangular, and dot. Each of them can be created using their own functions.

The cylindrical wall function (\texttt{cylindricalWall}) takes in the boundary array (\texttt{boundary}), the cylinder's center (\texttt{cylinderCenter}) as a tuple in the format $(y, x)$, and the cylinder's radius (\texttt{cylinderRadius: float}) as a floating point number, and modify the boundary array such that there's a wall with cylinder with radius \texttt{cylinderRadius} centered at the point $(y, x)$. The implementation is as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
def cylindricalWall(
        boundary,
        cylinderCenter: tuple, cylinderRadius: float
    ):
    for yIndex, xIndex in itr.product(
        range(yResolution), range(xResolution)
    ):
        if math.dist(cylinderCenter, [yIndex, xIndex]) <= cylinderRadius:
            boundary[yIndex, xIndex] = True
\end{minted}
The border wall function (\texttt{borderWall}) takes in the boundary array (\texttt{boundary}), and the thickness of the border (\texttt{thickness: int = 1}) as an integer, then modifies the boundary array such that there is a border around the simulation. This function is called to create a box surrounding the fluid.
\begin{minted}{python}
def borderWall(boundary, thickness: int = 1):
    boundary[0 : yResolution, -1 + thickness] = True
    boundary[0 : yResolution, xResolution - thickness] = True
    boundary[-1 + thickness, 0 : xResolution] = True
    boundary[yResolution - thickness, 0 : xResolution] = True
\end{minted}

The rectangular wall function is used to create a rectangular wall inside the simulation. It takes in the boundary array (\texttt{boundary}) and the position of the two corner points of the rectangle (\texttt{cornerCoord1: tuple, cornerCoord2: tuple}) as a tuple in the format $(y, x)$. It's implemented as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
def filledStraightRectangularWall(
    boundary,
    cornerCoord1: tuple,
    cornerCoord2: tuple
):
    maxY = max(cornerCoord1[0], cornerCoord2[0])
    minY = min(cornerCoord1[0], cornerCoord2[0])
    maxX = max(cornerCoord1[1], cornerCoord2[1])
    minX = min(cornerCoord1[1], cornerCoord2[1])

    for yIndex, xIndex in itr.product(
        range(yResolution), range(yResolution)
    ):
        if (
            (xIndex <= maxX)
            and (xIndex >= minX)
            and (yIndex <= maxY)
            and (yIndex >= minY)
        ):
            boundary[yIndex, xIndex] = True
\end{minted}

Lastly, the dot wall (\texttt{dotWalls}) just takes in the boundary array (\texttt{boundary}) and some coordinates, then modifies the \texttt{boundary} array so that those coordinates are walls.
\begin{minted}{python}
def dotWalls(boundary, *args: tuple):
    for position in args:
        boundary[position[0], position[1]] = True
\end{minted}

Since these four functions directly modifies the \texttt{boundary} array, they must be called before imposing the wall boundaries to the \texttt{fluid} array.

In some cases, it's more favorable to use the indices of the boundaries directly. The \texttt{NumPy} array can be converted to a list of indices by the function \texttt{generateIndex}. This function takes in the boundary array (\texttt{boundary}), and outputs two arrays: \texttt{boundaryIndex} and \texttt{invertedBoundaryIndex}. The \texttt{boundaryIndex} list contains the indices of walls. Invert that list, and you get the \texttt{invertedBoundaryIndex}, which contains the indices of fluids. The function is implemented as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
def generateIndex(boundary):
    boundaryIndex = []
    invertedBoundaryIndex = []
    for i, j in itr.product(
        range(yResolution), range(xResolution)
    ):
        if boundary[i, j] != False:
            boundaryIndex.append((i, j))
        else:
            invertedBoundaryIndex.append((i, j))
    return boundaryIndex, invertedBoundaryIndex
\end{minted}

Since the end goal of this project is to simulate air conditioner placements, we also have to know the possible indices that the air conditioner can end up at. Therefore, we build a function \texttt{generateACPos} that can do so:
\begin{minted}{python}
def generateACDirections(boundary):
    possibleACPos = []
    for shiftIndex, axisIndex in itr.product([-1, 1], [1, 0]):
        shiftedBoundary = np.roll(boundary, shift=shiftIndex, axis=axisIndex)
        possibleACPos = np.logical_or(
            possibleACPos,
            np.logical_not(boundary) & shiftedBoundary
        )
    return possibleACPos
\end{minted}
This function takes in a boundary array (\texttt{boundary}) and return a list of possible air conditioner positions (\texttt{possibleACPos}). It works by shifting the \texttt{boundary} array along the four cardinal directions ($i = 1, 2, 3, 4$) by using the \texttt{np.roll} function. Then, comparing the shifted array to the original array. If a point $(n, m)$ in the original array isn't a wall, but the point $(n, m)$ on the shifted array along direction $i$ isn't a wall, then an air conditioner that faces direction $i$ can be put at point $(n, m)$. All the possible points from all directions are combined using \texttt{np.logical\_or} to obtain an array that contains all the point that can hold an air conditioner (\texttt{possibleACPos}).

Another requirement for gradient descent is that the parameters must be continuous; therefore, one must be able to stretch the two-dimensional contour of the possible air conditioner positions into a line. The function \texttt{indexPossibleACPos} will do just that. It's implemented doing breadth first search along a line until it comes back, or that the line terminates.
\begin{minted}{python}
def indexPossibleACPos(possibleACPos, clear: bool = False):
    testArray = copy.deepcopy(possibleACPos)
    currentIndex = tuple()
    for yIndex, xIndex in itr.product(
        range(yResolution), range(xResolution)
    ):
        if testArray[yIndex, xIndex]:
            currentIndex = (yIndex, xIndex)
            break

    while testArray[currentIndex]:
        for latticeIndex in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0]:
            nextIndex = addTuple(
                currentIndex,
                (
                    unitX[latticeIndex],
                    unitY[latticeIndex],
                ),
            )
            if testArray[nextIndex]:
                possibleACIndex.append(nextIndex)
                testArray[currentIndex] = 0
                currentIndex = nextIndex
                break
            else:
                pass
\end{minted}

\subsection{Density boundary condition}

The interpretation of this boundary condition isn't really to fix a density at a certain point. Rather, it is to make a point spew out the liquids continuously; therefore, the fluid vectors can just be set explicitly after each simulation iteration. Although I want this chapter to be liberated from object-oriented programming paradigm, this one just can't. Therefore, I shall introduce a new class: the \texttt{DensityBoundary} class, which is implemented as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
class DensityBoundary:
    def __init__(self, y: int, x: int, magnitude: float, direction: int):
        self.y = y
        self.x = x
        self.magnitude = magnitude
        self.direction = direction
\end{minted}
This class contains the position of the density boundary condition (\texttt{y} and \texttt{x}), the magnitude of density, and the direction that the density is imposed. The density boundary condition is imposed as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
velocityBoundaries = []
def imposeDensityBoundaryCondition(boundary, velocityBoundaries):
    for velocityBoundary in velocityBoundaries:
        fluid[
            velocityBoundary.y, velocityBoundary.x, velocityBoundary.direction
        ] = velocityBoundary.magnitude
    updateSpeed()
\end{minted}

\subsection{Wall-velocity boundary condition}

The wall-velocity boundary condition is also implemented as a class (\texttt{VelocityBoundary}) which is initialized with the $(y, x)$ position of the boundary condition, and the velocity along direction $\vv{e}_a, \vv{e}_b$. It's implemented as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
class VelocityBoundary:
    indices = [[1, 8, 5], [2, 5, 6], [3, 6, 7], [4, 7, 8]]

    def __init__(self, y: int, x: int, ux, uy, direction: int):
        self.y = y
        self.x = x
        self.uy = uy
        self.ux = ux
        self.direction = direction

        # For calculating the ua and ub
        reflectIndex = (direction - 2) if (direction in [3, 4]) else (direction + 2)

        self.mainVelocity = ux if (direction in [1, 3]) else uy
        self.minorVelocity = uy if (direction in [1, 3]) else ux
        self.setIndices = VelocityBoundary.indices[direction - 1]
        self.getIndices = VelocityBoundary.indices[reflectIndex - 1]
\end{minted}

All the velocity boundaries point are then stored as an object of the class \texttt{VelocityBoundaries} in a list called \texttt{velocityBoundaries}. We then iterate over the list to update the fluid simulation grid according to \cref{eq:velocity-boundary-1,eq:velocity-boundary-2,eq:velocity-boundary-3}.

\begin{minted}{python}
velocityBoundaries = [] # A list of pressure boundaries point
def imposeVelocityBoundaryCondition(fluid, velocityBoundaries):
    for velocityBoundary in velocityBoundaries:
        for latticeIndex in range(9):
            fluid[velocityBoundary.y, pressureBoundary.x, latticeIndex] = 0
        densityAtIndex = density[velocityBoundary.y, pressureBoundary.x]
        fluid[
            velocityBoundary.y, pressureBoundary.x, pressureBoundary.setIndices[0]
        ] = fluid[
            velocityBoundary.y, pressureBoundary.x, pressureBoundary.getIndices[0]
        ] + (
            2 / 3
        ) * (
            velocityBoundary.mainVelocity
        )
        fluid[
            velocityBoundary.y, velocityBoundary.x, velocityBoundary.setIndices[1]
        ] = (
            fluid[
                velocityBoundary.y,
                velocityBoundary.x,
                velocityBoundary.getIndices[1],
            ]
            - (
                0.5
                * (
                    fluid[
                        velocityBoundary.y,
                        velocityBoundary.x,
                        (
                            4
                            if velocityBoundary.direction - 1 == 0
                            else velocityBoundary.direction - 1
                        ),
                    ]
                    - fluid[
                        velocityBoundary.y,
                        velocityBoundary.x,
                        (
                            1
                            if velocityBoundary.direction + 1 == 5
                            else velocityBoundary.direction + 1
                        ),
                    ]
                )
            )
            + (0.5 * densityAtIndex * velocityBoundary.minorVelocity)
            + (1 / 6 * densityAtIndex * velocityBoundary.mainVelocity)
        )
        fluid[
            velocityBoundary.y, velocityBoundary.x, velocityBoundary.setIndices[2]
        ] = (
            fluid[
                velocityBoundary.y,
                velocityBoundary.x,
                velocityBoundary.getIndices[2],
            ]
            + (
                0.5
                * (
                    self.fluid[
                        velocityBoundary.y,
                        velocityBoundary.x,
                        (

                            else velocityBoundary.direction - 1
                        ),
                    ]

                            1
                            if velocityBoundary.direction + 1 == 5
                            else velocityBoundary.direction + 1
                        ),
                    ]
                )
            )
            - (0.5 * densityAtIndex * velocityBoundary.minorVelocity)
            + (1 / 6 * densityAtIndex * velocityBoundary.mainVelocity)
        )
\end{minted}

\section{Simulation functions}
\label{sec:simulation-function}

There are three functions that are used: \texttt{streamFluid}, \texttt{bounceBackFluid}, and \texttt{collideFluid}. All of which follows the main steps of the Lattice-Boltzmann method: streaming, self-collision, and wall boundary.

\paragraph{Streaming step} Earlier, we calculated the value of $\vv{e}_i\vdot\yhat$ and $\vv{e}_i\vdot\xhat$, and stored it into the array \texttt{unitX} and \texttt{unitY}. These quantities are then used to shift the array in their respective directions, representing the streaming step.
\begin{minted}{python}
def streamFluid(fluid):
    for latticeIndex, shiftY, shiftX in zip(range(9), unitY, unitX):
        fluid[:, :, latticeIndex] = np.roll(
            fluid[:, :, latticeIndex], shiftY, axis=0
        )
        fluid[:, :, latticeIndex] = np.roll(
            fluid[:, :, latticeIndex], shiftX, axis=1
        )
\end{minted}

\paragraph{Self-collision step} The code follows from \cref{eq:self-collision-calculation-1,eq:self-collision-calculation-2}. It iterates through every fluid vectors in a lattice and update them accordingly.
\begin{minted}{python}
def collideFluid(fluid):
    fluidEquilibrium = np.zeros(fluid.shape)
    for latticeIndex, cy, cx, w in zip(
        range(9), unitY, unitX, weight,
    ):
        fluidEquilibrium[:, :, latticeIndex] = (
            density
            * w
            * (
                1
                + 3 * (cx * speedX + cy * speedY)
                + 9 * (cx * speedX + cy * speedY) ** 2 / 2
                - 3 * (speedX**2 + speedY**2) / 2
            )
        )
    fluid += (fluidEquilibrium - fluid) / relaxationTime
\end{minted}

\paragraph{Imposing wall boundary condition} We define a dictionary \texttt{reflectIndices} to convert from the index that's pointing into the wall to the index that points opposing the wall. The elements of the dictionary directly reflect the relation given by \cref{eq:wall-boundary-calculation-relation}. The part that updates the fluid directly reflects \cref{eq:wall-boundary-calculation}.

\begin{minted}{python}
boundaryIndex, invertedBoundaryIndex = generateIndex(boundary)
reflectIndices = {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 7, 6: 8, 7: 5, 8: 6}
def bounceBackFluid(fluid):
    for y, x in boundaryIndex:
        for latticeIndex in range(9):
            if fluid[y, x, latticeIndex] != 0:
                bounceIndexY = y - unitY[latticeIndex]
                bounceIndexX = x - unitX[latticeIndex]
                if (bounceIndexY >= 0 and bounceIndexY < yResolution) and (
                    bounceIndexX >= 0 and bounceIndexX < xResolution
                ):
                    fluid[
                        bounceIndexY,
                        bounceIndexX,
                        reflectIndices[latticeIndex],
                    ] = fluid[y, x, latticeIndex]
                    fluid[y, x, latticeIndex] = 0
    updateSpeed()
\end{minted}

\section{Simulation loop}

We first define a counter that counts the amount of times that we ran the simulation: \texttt{step}. For further comparison, we deep-copy the state of the fluid before updating to the variable \texttt{lastStepFluid}. Then, the fluid vector is updated in order: stream, bounce back, self-collide, impose velocity, and impose density.
\begin{minted}{python}
step = 1
def stepSimulation(fluid):
    lastStepFluid = copy.deepcopy(fluid)
    streamFluid()
    bounceBackFluid()
    collideFluid()
    imposeVelocityBoundaryCondition()
    imposePressureBoundaryCondition()
    step += 1
\end{minted}

Then, another function is implemented as a way to loop over the step function:
\begin{minted}{python}
def simulate(fluid, step: int = 1):
    [stepSimulation(fluid) for i in range(step)]
\end{minted}

\section{Metrics and baseline function}

A more explicit form of the problem is
\begin{quote}
	\emph{Find the air conditioner position that makes the system reaches the equilibrium the fastest.}
\end{quote}
So, it's necessary to have a function that will simulate the fluid until equilibrium. Here, the word \emph{equilibrium} is defined as the point in which the difference in the sum of fluid vector between the last simulation step (\texttt{lastStepFluid}), and the current step (\texttt{fluid}), is smaller than a set threshold (\texttt{equilibriumThreshold}), which is normally set to be $0.5$. The function that determines whether the system has reached equilibrium or not is called \texttt{isEquilibrium}. This function takes in a fluid state and its past state, then outputs a boolean. If it's true, then the system has reached equilibrium, otherwise, it hasn't.
\begin{minted}{python}
def isAtDensityEquilibirum(
    fluid, lastStepFluid, threshold: float = 0.5
):
    error = np.sum(np.abs(self.lastStepFluid - self.fluid))
    return not (error >= threshold)
\end{minted}

The function to simulate until equilibrium also needs some care. Firstly, some initial condition where the simulation is numerically unstable, so the simulation has to be terminated before it uses up all the memory. This can be done by terminating the simulation when the sum of the fluid vectors reaches a certain threshold: the \texttt{explodeThreshold}. Secondly, some initial condition isn't numerically unstable, but doesn't reach an equilibrium either, so the amount of simulation passes limit (\texttt{limit}) must be set to control how many steps the simulation can take before forcing it to terminate. Altogether, the \texttt{simulateUntilEquilibrium} function is implemented as follows:
\begin{minted}{python}
def simulateUntilEquilibrium(
    fluid,
    limit: int = 5000,
    equilibriumThreshold: float = 0.5,
    explodeThreshold: float = 11 * xResolution * yResolution,
):
    step = 0
    isStable = True
    for _ in range(limit):
        stepSimulation()
        step += 1
        if np.sum(self.fluid) > explodeThreshold:
            isStable = False
            break
        if isAtDensityEquilibirum(equilibriumThreshold):
            break
    
    return step, isStable
\end{minted}

\section{Plotting the results}

Plotting various aspects of the fluid simulation is quite straightforward with the framework that we've built. The density plot can be achieved directly by using the \texttt{imshow} function. \cite{matplotlib-imshow}
\begin{minted}{python}
plt.imshow(density, cmap="hot", interpolation="hermite")
\end{minted}
where \texttt{cmap} is the color map, and \texttt{interpolation} is the color map smoothing algorithm. The full list of options for both of these can be found in Matplotlib's documentation: \cite{matplotlib-cmap} (\texttt{cmap}), and \cite{matplotlib-interpolation} (\texttt{interpolation}).

The momentum density and the velocity density can be directly plotted along with the \texttt{quiver} function from Matplotlib. \cite{matplotlib-quiver}
\begin{minted}{python}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
heatmap = ax.imshow(
    densityPlot, cmap = "hot", interpolation = "hermite"
)
quivermap = ax.quiver(xIndex, yIndex, momentumX, -momentumY)
# Change momentumX, -momentumY to speedX, and speedY to plot the velocity instead of momentum.
fig.colorbar(heatmap)
plt.show()
\end{minted}
The \texttt{momentumY} has to have a negative sign upfront because \texttt{matplotlib} libraries doesn't invert the $y$ and $x$ axes like the \texttt{NumPy} convention. Further modifications of the plot can be found in Matplotlib's quiver documentation: \cite{matplotlib-quiver}.
