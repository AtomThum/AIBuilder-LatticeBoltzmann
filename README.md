# AIBuilder-LatticeBoltzmann

## Problem Statement
Heat is something every Thai person knows well. Every room in this country has at least 1 fan or air conditioner (AC); the prevalence of these heat pumps has made people ignorant about the various ways we could increase their efficiency. If some section of the room is too hot, we just turn it up without much care. However, placement and direction play a larger role than you would think in cooling a room. The direction of its output in relation to the contours of the room can be the difference between hot and cold. There are viable frameworks out there that can be used to find the optimal position for a given room, but the time required to model the room and run the systems are costly. Thus, our goal is to create an AI that can internalize the relationships between room layout and optimal AC position, in order to shortcut the simulation process.

## Data Collection/Generation

Our AI was trained using information consisting of:

Data‚ÄîThe shape of the room in as .png files
Labels‚ÄîThe best air conditioner position as a tuple (ùëå, ùëã) 

These were generated using a fluid simulation created based on the 2D Lattice-Boltzman framework, the AC being considered as a velocity boundary (A point in our room with constant velocity). The rooms were generated by placing combinations of different-sized obstacles (circles or squares) that air couldn‚Äôt flow through on 12 possible positions along a 32 x 32 square. Every possible AC position for each room (that being points next to a wall or an obstacle, and air) was simulated and averaged along the viable directions that the AC could point. The fastest of these positions to cool the entire room were considered the optimal point.

## AI Training and Evaluation
We used the mean squared error, which in our model was indicative of distance, to measure our model‚Äôs accuracy. We set a baseline of around 1024 (the MSE for a distance of 32 pixels from the optimal position) based on the fact that all our rooms started as a 32 x 32 square.

We chose to use a Convolutional Neural Network as the type of AI to fit our data to, due to its versatility in dealing with pictures. Our model has ten layers, consisting of Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers. After around 400 epochs, we were able to produce a model that could predict the position to within 2 pixels of the actual optimal position which, compared to our baseline, is a success.
